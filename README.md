# Geochase

## Why?
### Enhancing Student Learning Outcome
- bridging theoretical class-room practicals and expensive field work
- using the nearby facades and pavements to teach mineral and rock identification

## What about?
### Saving time to prepare a Geochase (Guide, Database, Inspiration)
This Github project summarizes main tasks and thoughts in order to prepare a local chase/scavenger hunt.
Also, it provides ideas and inspiration to design such chase.

## For whom?
### Support for Lecturers in Earth Sciences to design trip for first yeart Earth Sciences students.
The suggested questions in this project are targeting students, who started studying minerals, rocks and the rock cycle.
Also, questions and locations are suggested for team building exercises and additional fundamental knowledge in Geosciences.
