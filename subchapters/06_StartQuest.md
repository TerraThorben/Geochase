# Starter Questions
## You should start easy and repeat important thing


You should start easy to boost the confidence of the students. I suggest also to include some fundamental questions to repeat the general knowledge to prepare upcoming questions. Here, students can learn something, which they can use later during the trip.


E.g. 
-  How do you navigate and orient yourself without a smartphone
Answer: Maps, compass, sun, stars, moos at trees, ...

  Later: Which building is located north/east… of you?

- Rocks are a assemblage out of …. Colours are a indicator for minerals. ...
    Later: How do you recognize different minerals in a rock at a first glance?


## Integrating stations, department, museum, church and parks
_Is your area located close to the campus or on the campus?_ 
Consider using the vitrines or posters in the hallway of your department. Also, it is possible to ask colleagues to set up stations, where a lecturer is explaining intruments, tools or even experiments. See chapter Stations. However, GPS within buildings is less precise than outside. Therefore, locations should not be to close to eachother, otherwise the wrong questions might be triggered.


_Is there an interesting museum closeby? A church?_
Some prominent building in a city have great facades, sculptures in front or even some intresting pillars or rocks inside.


_Park and water?_
Parks allow space for some fun activities, doing a charade or another game. Also, sculptures or rocks/borders around flowerbeds can be source for a different rock type question. In addition, general questions about environment or similar can be ask to widen the spectrum of questions.
