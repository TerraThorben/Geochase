## Acknowledgement

I would like to thank myPeek, Roger Herbert, Karin Högdahl, and Uppsala University to support the first version of the Geochase in Uppsala, which is the fundament for this guide. In addition, I thank my colleagues at TU Delft: Rémi Charton, Tobias Schmiedel and Jan Kees Blom for their insights of organising a chase for students.
