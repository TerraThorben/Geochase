# Before you start

## Explore your local facilites and check out facades, pavements, parks, ....

Setting up a chase/scavenger hunt takes effort and time. You need to scout the city and sourrounding to find suitable locations with e.g. polished facades, fossils in walls, minerals in pavements, and similar, within a close distance. Afterwards, you need to design the questions and their answers/feedback for these locations. Then, you might need to fill stations between „long“ distances between the urban outcrops with some educative content and/or fun exercise. To reduce the time of preparation, phrasing questions and thinking about team building exercises, this guide and database will support you. 


### _Advice - avoid long distances between locations_
The might be a suberp facade at one side of the city and another fascinating sculpture in the park on the other side of the city.
If the distance if to far, it is worth to skip one of the location if it is off the main route of the chase, although the minerals inside are outstanding. Think about the time students need to walk and answering questions. 

## Paper or App?

- Designing a chase **on paper** might save time compared to setting up an chase on an app by describing a locations, questions, answer possibilites and feedback. But, evaluating the answers on the paper chase takes time afterwards. In addition, student receive immediate feedback (if not an open text answer), which helps learning immediatly. It is worth to invest in using an app service to get technical support. 

- I tested and can recommend following **apps**:
(Please, feel free to communicate other alternatives)

    - [myPeek](https://www.peek.app/) - service team behind for additional support
    - [Actiobbound](https://en.actionbound.com/) - free of charge for personal use/test
    - [Scavengar](https://scavengar.world/) - Augmented Reality Trip - only IOS at the moment

The first two apps work very similar and the backends are straightforward to set up a trip. You can also download the student´s results and pictures to evaluate it on your computer and receive statistics at the end. However, setting up location and filling descriptions, questions, answers, feedback etc. takes some time. Use this chase for many occasions and courses over several semesters and the effort will be paid out. In this way, you can also improve and adapt your chase step by step.  


- Have you also thought using **QR codes**? Instead of using questions on paper or an app, which is navigating around,
 it is also fun to distribute QR codes (and using a map) to guide to questions online (e.g. student portal, course page, github pages...)and around the city.

 ## Grading or not?

 The chase and apps also provide the opportunity to grade (giving points/pass or fail) to the users. 
 It is up to you, if you want to grade such activity and the engagement of the students or not. However, grading can increase the pressure
 and if student can only answer once, they might be afraid answering and pressure increased, which has a negative aspect on the fun.
 However, decision making of the students will be increased anyway. 

 ## Group work?
 Working in groups is fun. Students get to know eachother and learn how to interact in a team.
 If students work in group, I suggest not more then 3-4 students sharing one device otherwise, not all students will listen to the task and involved in decision making process.
If students work and you want to see who participates, follow the advice in the next chapter.

## The right balance
It is important to have good balance between the different activities and types of questions within a chase. However, running a chase over several semsters allows modifying/improving  the chase continously.

Think about the technical opportunities and limitations as well as potential of the city.
