# Before and after the chase

**Before** the students do the chase, some basic knowledge in rock and mineral identification might be suitful. They do not need to expert and at the cirriculum of the course, but the knowledge gained in the first few theoretical lectures can be applied and then, this chase will enhance the learning outcome by applying the first knowledge. Moreover, with the decision making during answering the question and immediate feedback through the app, will help to apply, learn and manifest knowledge.

**In advance**, students should be notified abot the chase and that they should wear appropriate clothing for the weather. In addition, the students should have a fully charged phone to run the app and download the app beforehand (some apps allow to continue the chase on a different phone, when there are problems with one). Additional tools might be needed in cases.

**Directly before the chase**, a short introduction about the chase is appropriate. The instructions should cover the expectations for this course, the task of the students, how they should run this chase and other organisational points. 

**During the trip**, if you assigned a meeting point within the chase or station, where you show or explain certain things, then it is time to go to this place and prepare for it. If students walk by theirself or if there is no direct activity after the last station, then it is important to be available online in cases of questions. There is also the opportunity to see the live results as soon as the students answered questions.


**After the chase**, the open text questions and pictures need to be evaluated and in few cases points were assigned. It is recommended to adress important points of the chase during one of the next classes and also show pictures from the fun team building exercise. In addition, such short evaluation session with the students helps to address important points that were recognized in the answers (e.g. missing scale on pictures, that is a mineral not a fossil, ...)

**Before the next chase**, used the feedback and insights from the previous chase and update the chase for the upcoming one. Also, make sure that the locations are still available and maybe add or remove locations.


## Uppsala Implementation
Before the Geochase, we sent around an e-mail to the students with intructions, how to prepare for the chase and what they will expect.
_Important points in e-mail:_
    - fun activity answering questions on the smartphone in the city centre
    - duration 2-3 h, students choose their own pace and breaks (stop for coffee)
    - appropriate clothing
    - download app _(but not sharing the code for the trip)_

Before the start of the Geochase in Uppsala, I introduced the chase to the students, how to use the app, how they should answer, reduced the pressure if student do not know the answer (since they are at the beginning of the study and are not expected to know everything), repeated very briefly how to describe minerals and rocks (think about the colour, shape, ...), reminded them not to destry the facades and pavements, and finally, organised the groups.

At the end, I provided the code for the trip (which is needed to activate the chase in the app), and wished them good luck. Since the first stations were at the meeting/start point, I was hanging around for half an hour to observe the students and being available in cases of questions or problems. 

During the chase, I was available online and started downloading the incoming pictures and evaluated open text questions. Actually, it is easier to wait for all answers after the students were done. Then, I downloaded the results and pictures, and put them on few slides to show them the students during the next class.

During the next class, I took 15 minutes to speak about the chase. I showed them the fun pictures and how other groups solved some stations. I repeated few basics, how to recognise some fossils or minerals at some locations (to encourage the students to revisist locations in the city if they pass by on their way to the club). Most fun was showing the pictures from some team building exercise and let the students guess what other groups have mimicked in the charade exercise.

After the chase, I noted down important insights from the this year chase for improving the recent version. Here and there, I discovered new places in the city centre of Uppsala and added them in the chase. Also, I recognized during revisiting some stations that some signs were removed, buildings are under constructions, or sculptures were moved. Consequently, I updated the chase continously and noted down some backup locations.
