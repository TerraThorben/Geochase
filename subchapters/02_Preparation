# Before you start

## Explore your local facilites and check out facades, pavements, parks, ....

Setting up a chase/scavenger hunt takes effort and time. You need to explore the city and sourrounding to find suitable locations with e.g. polished facades, fossils in walls, minerals in pavements, and similar, within a close distance. Afterwards, you need to design the questions and their answers/feedback for these locations. Then, you might need to fill stations between „long“ distances between the urban outcrops with some educative content and/or fun exercise. To reduce the time of preparation, phrasing questions and thinking about team building exercises, this guide and database will support you. 


### Advice
The might be a suberp facade at one side of the city and another fascinating sculpture in the park on the other side of the city.
If the distance if to far, it is worth to skip one of the location if it is off the main route of the chase, although the minerals inside are outstanding. Think about the time students need to walk and answering questions.
