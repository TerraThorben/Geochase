# Question Types and Design

## Question types:
-   open text
-   multiple choice
-   taking pictures
-   quessing and measuring


### Open Text
Students need to use their own words to phrase an answer and need to think more compared to multiple choice questions. I also allows to let the students explain their answer or describe minerals and rocks in more detail. However, students do not receive immediate feedback. 

E.g., 
- Please, describe the minerals in this facade (e.g., size, shape, colour).
- This brigde is made out of steel and iron. Do you know a mining area in this country?
- What is your name and team name?


### Multiple Choice
Multiple choice questions have the advantage to assign correct and wrong answers, and to give direct feedback after answering. Direct feedback is important for the learning effect of the students. Also, providing answers give the students some confidence, since they are just new in this field and may have not learned everything by heart during the first days.

### Taking Picutres
Since students use their smartphone during the chase, they should take pictures for a) their own memory and b) sharing moments with others.

E.g.
- Take a picture of a fossil in the wall.
- Please, charade a volcano eruption or tsumani. _(see team building exercises)_
- Take a group picture. 

### Quessing and measuring
It is possible in the apps to assign a number or an interval as an answer.

E.g.
- When was this house build?
- How deep is the deepest borehole in the world?
- What is the slope/inclination of this roof?
- Which Sustainable Development Goals is ...?
- How high are you above sea level?

## Balance

Rocks, Minerals, Rock Cylce and general Geoscience
some skills, and team building

## Design

short, not much text
visualas, including images
references to explore more
short videos or recordings?

live demonstrations?

e.g. "How old is the building?", then you need to update the answer each year (which is an additional task to think about every year).
