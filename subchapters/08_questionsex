# Examples of Questions / a short database for inspiration
Here, you find questions examples and feedback text for potential stations. However, since most of the chase depends on the facades in your city, this are additional questions that can be phrased along the chase **as multiple-choice question** (to reduce time in grading the results and triggering immediate feedback to the students to enhance the learning outcome).
