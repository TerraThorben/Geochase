# Why a Geochase through the city?
## Gamification to enhance learning outcome

Such a chase is filling the gap between theory in class and practical experience during field work. Moreover, classes in mineral and rock identification are at the beginning of a curriculum and the beginning of studying Earth Sciences (or similar) at a university. Consequently, students are new and team building exercises are appreciated, while learning that rocks and minerals are not nerdy; they are everywhere. Also, this chase is an additional opportunity to strengthen the skills in rock and mineral identification with fun activities. 

## Pros and Cons

**Advantage**
- fun activity for students
- enhances learning outcome
- enriching teaching activity
- reaching students in a different way


**Disadvantage**
- Takes time (scouting city, designing questions and feedback, setting up the app, ...)
