# Involve colleagues or other disciplines

If time and space allows, why not asking your colleages from Geophysics or others to make one location. At this location, they do an experiment with the sudents to teaser techniques, methods or skills that will be taught at a later stage.

For example, setting up a seismic station and students need to jump or hammer next to it. Similar, can be done showing additional rocks and minerals from the collection or even use old rock samples that can be destroyed by hammering etc.
