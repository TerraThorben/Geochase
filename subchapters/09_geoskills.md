# Additional Geological skills

In Geosciences, we make use of several tool and skills. Such skills will be obtained during later and advanced courses in Geology and Earth Sciences, e.g. during mapping courses and field work. However, it might be good to start with some guessing questions and sketching exercises. As feedback for such questions, it is good to mention important aspects of certain skills.
(If your city location allows, why not giving the students a hand lense, hammer, compas etc.).


## Example Questions
### Measuring and Guessing Ideas

- Is there a slope in the city, inclinced street, an oblique tree or rounded bridge?
Here, students can quess the angle of inclination or length.

- Where is North?
Similar as mentioned for the first questions, where students need to say how they orient without a smartphone and GPS, here, students
have to say which building is located North, South, East, .... 

- Hammertime?
Usually, students should NOT scratch or hammer facades or similar in the city. However, setting up a station in your department, where students can work with old rock samples might be worth.

- Taking notes and sketches
It is crucial to make proper descriptions, notes and sketches for a Geoscientist. Unfortunately, most apps do not allow extensive text answers or sketches due to technical limitations, except, they take a picture of their notes/sketch or submit a paper version after the chase. However, taking pictures, short descriptions in open text questions or providing answers in multiple choice questions are good alternatives, if [designed well](https://github.com/TerraThorben/Geochase/blob/main/subchapters/05_questiontypes.md).



- Scale at pictures
Taking pictures during the chase is an easy thing. However, students can learn how to take appropriate and what scientific pictures should contrain, e.g., an appropriate scale.
