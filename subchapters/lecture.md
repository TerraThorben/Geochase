# Before and after the chase

Before the students do the chase, some basic knowledge in rock and mineral identification might be suitful. They do not need to expert and at the cirriculum of the course, but the knowledge gained in the first few theoretical lectures can be applied and then, this chase will enhance the learning outcome by applying the first knowledge. Moreover, with the decision making during answering the question and immediate feedback through the app, will help to apply, learn and manifest knowledge.

Directly before the chase, a short introduction about the chase is appropriate. The instructions should cover the expectations for this course, the task of the students, how they should run this chase and other organisational points.
