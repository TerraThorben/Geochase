# Which information to you need from the students
## To grade or not to grade is the question

The first questions can be administrational by porpuse. If you want to grade or check presence of students, the students should note their names. Here, there is an option to be creative a take a team picture, give themselves a team name or note their favourite mineral.


Questions for start:

- What is your team-name?
- Who is in your team?
- Please, take a team picture for your memory.


## Advice and Saftey instructions to students
In the introduction of the chase, make sure to remind the students on general behaviour and saftey regulations, e.g., no climbing on statues, being respectful in a church, mind the traffic, avoid blocking bike lanes.


## Uppsala Implementation
We used the Geochase in Uppsala for three different courses, each with different expectations to the students. With the administrative questions, we tracked the participation of the students and for one course, we assigned points to give the students a "pass" or "fail". However, the degree of passing the course was very low. Here, we noticed, that the students lost their motivation in visiting all stations, when they assumed that they pass.

In one version of the Geochase, we also voted for the best and creative team picture and name. That is done in the aftermath of the chase and the next day in class.

The Geochase in Uppsala started with a short introduction by the lecturer. The students inserted a code in the downloaded app on their smartphone to access the chase and were welcomed with a short notice on saftey regulations during the trip.
