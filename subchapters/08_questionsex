# Examples of Questions / a short database for inspiration
Here, you find questions examples and feedback text for potential stations. However, since most of the chase depends on the facades in your city, this are additional questions that can be phrased along the chase **as multiple-choice question** (to reduce time in grading the results and triggering immediate feedback to the students to enhance the learning outcome).


## Q about Minerals
1. What is the chemical formula of Quartz?
 Ans: SiO2
 Feedback: Yes, it is Si02. Do you know that quartz is the secound common mineral in the Earth´s lithosphere?

2. Which is the most common mineral in the Earth´s crust?
  Ans: Felspar
  Feedback: Felspar is the most common mineral in the Earth´s crust with Plagioclase ~38% and K-felspar ~ 12% 

3. Which mineral has thin platy sheets as a shape.
  Ans: Mica
  Feedback: Mica such as light-coloured muscovite or dark-colour biotite are soft and platy. They are commonly found in igneous and metamorphic rocks.

4. Which minerals can be scratch with your finger nail?
  Ans: Minerals softer than 2.5 on the Mohs Hardness Scale.

5. What is the hardest mineral?
 Ans: Diamond.

6. Which minerals react with acid?
 Ans: Carbonates such as Calcite, Dolomite

7. Which mineral tastes salty?
Ans: Halite.

8. What have Kyanite, Andalusite, and Sillimanite in common?
Ans: They have the same chemical formula (Al2SiO5), but are different in crystal structure and appearance.

## Q about Rocks
1. Which main minerals are used to classify magmatic rocks in the QPF diagram?
 Ans: Quartz, Plagioclase, Felspar
 Feedback: Correct/Wrong...

2. What is the difference between intrusive and extrusive rocks?
 Ans: The grain size.

3. What is a difference between mafic and felsic rocks?
Ans: Mafic rocks are darker compared to felsic rocks, also indicating that "brighter" rocks contain more silica. Also, felsic rocks hac a lower density.

4. Which rock reacts when dropping some acid on if and it starts to react by producing bubbles and foam?
    Ans: Limestone.
    Feedback: If you rock reacts on the acid, then it is a clear identification for a
    limestone/carbonate.

5. Fossil are found usually in which rock type?
   Ans: Sedimentary rocks.

## Q about the Rock Cycle

1. What is the process called when a limestone turns into a marble.
Ans: Metamorphism.

2. If hot magma intrudes as a dyke into a sandstone, the rocks in the contact zone between the magma and sandstone are modified by the hot temperature. How is that process calles?
Ans: Metamorphism.

3. If mountain building processes lift up metamorphic rocks, these rocks exhibts more climatic weathering and they break down. Wind and water transport the broken rocks and minerals far away. What is process that settles down the rocks and minerals to a new rock formation?
Ans: Sedimentation.

4. If a sediment melts to a viscous to fluidal state due to high temperatures. What type of rock is it now?
Ans: A magma. 


5. What is lava?
 Ans: Lava is erupted magma.
