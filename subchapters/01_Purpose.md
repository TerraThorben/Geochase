# Why a Geochase through the city?
## Gamification to enhance learning outcome

Such a chase is filling the gap between theory in class and practical experience during field work. Moreover, classes in mineral and rock identification are at the beginning of a curriculum and the beginning of studying Earth Sciences (or similar) at a university. Consequently, students are new and team building exercises are appreciated, while learning that rocks and minerals are not nerdy; they are everywhere. Also, this chase is an additional opportunity to strengthen the skills in rock and mineral identification with different fun activities. By answering questions in groups, students enhance their decision making and working in teams, as well as learning how to organise and navigate themselves.

## Pros and Cons

**Advantage**
- fun activity for students
- enhances learning outcome
- enriching teaching activity
- reaching students in a different way

- different types of rocks are easy to access
- flexibility of chase (adapting level of knowledge)
- interaction with the city + sustainable knowledge
- only limited by your creativity

 > student quote: "I cannot go to my favourite coffee place anymore without thinking about the minerals at the entrance."


**Disadvantage**
- extensive preparation time (scouting city, designing questions and feedback, setting up the app, ...)
- no hammering, no scratching, no acid
- perfect polished rocks/facades (not as in nature)
- no relationship between rocks (e.g. contact, orientation, ...)
