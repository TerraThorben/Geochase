# Question Types and Design
Here, general information and advices about the types of questions are discussed. Examples of questions are given in the next chapters.

## Common Question types in Apps:
-   open text
-   multiple choice
-   taking pictures
-   quessing and measuring


### Open Text
Students need to use their own words to phrase an answer and need to think more compared to multiple choice questions. I also allows to let the students explain their answer or describe minerals and rocks in more detail. However, students do not receive immediate feedback and evaluating answers takes time. 

E.g., 
- Please, describe the minerals in this facade (e.g., size, shape, colour).
- This brigde is made out of steel and iron. Do you know a mining area in this country?
- What is your name and team name?

### Multiple Choice
The advantage of multiple-choice questions is that they allow you to assign correct and incorrect answers and provide direct feedback after the student has answered. Direct feedback is important for students' learning. Providing answers also gives students confidence, since they are new to this field and may not have learnt everything by heart yet.

### Taking Picutres
Since students use their smartphone during the chase, they should take pictures for a) their own memory and b) sharing moments with others.

E.g.
- Take a picture of a fossil in the wall.
- Please, charade a volcano eruption or tsumani. _(see [team bulding exercises](https://github.com/TerraThorben/Geochase/blob/main/subchapters/11_teambuilding.md))_
- Take a group picture. 

### Quessing and measuring
It is possible in the apps to assign a number or an interval as an answer.

E.g.
- When was this house build?
- How deep is the deepest borehole in the world?
- What is the slope/inclination of this roof?
- Which Sustainable Development Goals is ...?
- How high are you above sea level?

## Balance

It is important to have good balance between the different activities and types of questions within a chase. However, running a chase over several semesters allows modifying/improving  the chase continously.

Think about the technical opportunities and limitations as well as potential of the city. 
Check out the question types with its dis-/advantages here.

Another balance should be considered among the question topics: Minerals, Rocks, Rock Cycle & General Knowledge.

## Design a question

It is recommended to get the student´s view. Beeing on an adventure, text should be exciting and encouraging, but often short and precise instructions and questions are the best. Since smartphone screens are small, long text and complex graphics will not appear well. Also, working groups means that one person is reading out loud to the group or even will not share all details. That doesn´t mean that some locations can contain extensive explainations, but mostly the instructions, information, questions and feedback should be short and condensed. 

A variation between using visuals, short videos, external links and recordings is appreciated. Also, additional interaction during live demonstrations increases the portfolio of activities during a chase.


## Avoid

Such a chase is designed to be re-used every semester over several years. This means there will be some maintaining of the chase. This maintainaces means not only revisiting quickly the locations, but also revising the questions. Questions should be neutral and timeless, otherwise updating the answers and feedback takes additional time.

e.g. - avoid:
 "How old is the building?", or "What is the current mineral of the year?",
  otherwise you need to update the answers each year (which is an additional task and time to think about every year).
