# Additional Geological skills

In Geosciences, we make use of several tool and skills. Such skills will be obtained during later and advanced courses in Geology and Earth Sciences, e.g. during mapping courses and field work. However, it might be good to start with some guessing questions and sketching exercises. As feedback for such questions, it is good to mention important aspects of certain skills.
(If your city location allows, why not giving the students a hand lense, hammer, compas etc.).


## Example Questions
### Measuring and Guessing Ideas

- Is there a slope in the city, inclinced street, an oblique tree or rounded bridge?
Here, students can quess the angle of inclination or length.

- Where is North?
Similar as mentioned for the first questions, where students need to say how they orient without a smartphone and GPS, here, students
have to say which building is located North, South, East, .... 

- Hammertime?




- taking notes and sketches
- scale at pictures
-
