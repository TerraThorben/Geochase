# Before you start

## Explore your local facilites and check out facades, pavements, parks, ....

Setting up a chase/scavenger hunt takes effort and time. You need to scout the city and sourrounding to find suitable locations with e.g. polished facades, fossils in walls, minerals in pavements, and similar, within a close distance. Afterwards, you need to design the questions and their answers/feedback for these locations. Then, you might need to fill stations between „long“ distances between the urban outcrops with some educative content and/or fun exercise. To reduce the time of preparation, phrasing questions and thinking about team building exercises, this guide and database will support you. 


### _Advice - avoid long distances between locations_
The might be a suberp facade at one side of the city and another fascinating sculpture in the park on the other side of the city. However, if distances between stations are too far, it is worth to skip one of the location, especially if it is off from the main route of the chase, although the minerals inside are outstanding. Think about the time students need to walk and answering questions. 

### _Advice - avoid temporal locations_
Choose stations/locations, which are expected to last long. E.g., sculptures, temporal exhibitions, signs at buildings or loose rocks in the park might be moved during the year.Updating many stations each year in a chase costs extra time. Also, if you have a guessing question to the students, e.g. "How old is the building?", then you need to update the answer each year (which is an additional task to think about every year).  

## Paper or App?

- Designing a chase **on paper** might save time compared to setting up an chase on an app by describing a locations, questions, answer possibilites and feedback. But, evaluating the answers on the paper chase takes time afterwards. In addition, student receive immediate feedback (if not an open text answer), which helps learning immediatly. It is worth to invest in using an app service to get technical support.

- I tested and can recommend following **apps**:
(Please, feel free to communicate other alternatives)

    - [myPeek](https://www.peek.app/) - service team behind for additional support
    - [Actiobbound](https://en.actionbound.com/) - free of charge for personal use/test
    - [Scavengar](https://scavengar.world/) - Augmented Reality Trip - only IOS at the moment

The first two apps work very similar and the backends are straightforward to set up a trip. You can also download the student´s results and pictures to evaluate it on your computer and receive statistics at the end. However, setting up location and filling descriptions, questions, answers, feedback etc. takes some time. Use this chase for many occasions and courses over several semesters and the effort will be paid out. In this way, you can also improve and adapt your chase step by step.  

**Pro App**

- Quick evaluation of answers 
- immediate feedback to students
- Interactive trip and additional fun
- Overview of students and their progress
- Enhances decision-making (individual work)
- Stimulates active engagement
- User-friendly app saves time
- Support by designers/developers
- Great alternative with sustainable gain of knowledge

**Con App**

- Preparation of trip and setting up takes some time
- Battery lifetime (need of mobile device)
- Need of internet connection
- No drawing yet (draw on paper and take picture)
- Limited set of questions design

_The evaluation the Geochase in Uppsala states that 93% of all participant prefer an app version instead of paper._

## Setting up with an App
Setting up a chase with an app is straight forward. There is not much programming skills needed. In most cases, the apps use a drop down menu and boxes to fill. Consequently, using one of the apps solves the technical concerns and also, there is a support team offering additional services for support.

## QR codes
- Have you also thought using **QR codes**? Instead of using questions on paper or an app, which is navigating around,
 it is also fun to distribute QR codes (and using a map) to guide to questions online (e.g. student portal, course page, github pages...)and around the city.

 ## Grading or not?

 The chase and apps also provide the opportunity to grade (giving points/pass or fail) to the users. 
 It is up to you, if you want to grade such activity and the engagement of the students or not. However, grading can increase the pressure
 and if student can only answer once, they might be afraid answering and pressure increased, which has a negative aspect on the fun.
 However, decision making of the students will be increased anyway. 

 ## Group work?
 Working in groups is fun. Students get to know eachother and learn how to interact in a team.
 If students work in group, I suggest not more then 3-4 students sharing one device otherwise, not all students will listen to the task and involved in decision making process.
If students work and you want to see who participates, follow the advice in the next chapter.

## The right balance
It is important to have good balance between the different activities and types of questions within a chase. However, running a chase over several semesters allows modifying/improving  the chase continously.

Think about the technical opportunities and limitations as well as potential of the city. 
Check out the question types with its dis-/advantages here.

Another balance should be considered among the question topics: Minerals, Rocks, Rock Cycle & General Knowledge.
