# Geochase

## Why?
### Enhancing Student Learning Outcome
- bridging theoretical class-room practicals and expensive field work
- using the nearby facades and pavements to teach mineral and rock identification

## What about?
### Saving time to prepare a Geochase (Guide, Database, Inspiration)
This Github project summarizes main tasks and thoughts in order to prepare a local chase/scavenger hunt.
Also, it provides ideas and inspiration to design such chase.

## For whom?
### Support for Lecturers in Earth Sciences to design trip for first yeart Earth Sciences students.
The suggested questions in this project are targeting students, who started studying minerals, rocks and the rock cycle.
Also, questions and locations are suggested for team building exercises and additional fundamental knowledge in Geosciences.

## Content
The following chapters provide insights and support for creating a chase, **step by step**.
Starting from scratch, first questions to designing questions and examples.
Each chapter explains the general purpose and procedure for this step, and shows how it is 
implemented in the examples of

## Acknowledgement

I would like to thank myPeek, Roger Herbert, Karin Högdahl, and Uppsala University to support the first version of the Geochase in Uppsala, which is the fundament for this guide. In addition, I thank my colleagues at TU Delft: Rémi Charton, Tobias Schmiedel and Jan Kees Blom for their insights of organising a chase for students.
